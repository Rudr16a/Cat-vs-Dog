## Introduction

This project aims to create an image classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras and can be trained and tested using Google Colab for easy access to GPU resources.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment images for better model performance.
- **CNN Model**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on a labeled dataset and evaluate its performance.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and neural networks

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-vs-dog-detection.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-detection
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `cat_vs_dog_detection.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the dataset and preprocess images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

2. **Build the Model**: Define the CNN architecture.

3. **Train the Model**: Train the model on the dataset.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new images.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `cat_vs_dog_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). It consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs (12,500 each).

## Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model consists of the following layers:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling
- Flatten layer
- Fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with Softmax activation

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs. Detailed results, including training and validation accuracy/loss plots, are provided in the notebook.
